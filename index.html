                        <p>I've made my home base in Lake Forest Park, Washington, with my fianc&#233; and our dog and three cats. My journey into technical writing started with working closely with technical writers as an executive assistant at a software company. I was fascinated with crafting content that was usable for its intended audience. I was hooked and wanted to transition to a career in technical writing. I supplemented my already strong background in writng, and my bachelor's degree in Economics, with a certificate in technical writing.</p>

                        <p>Now, I'm a Technical Writer/User Assistance Developer at Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. I specialize in developing content for an internal engineering audience. I use my writing skills and eye for detail to produce content that has the quality of customer-facing documentation. I develop content with the help of brilliant subject matter experts, Confluence, HTML, Acrolinx, Git, and Bitbucket. My goal in writing is to create usable, accessible, refreshing, and elegant documentation.</p>
